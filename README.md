# Customer-Churn-Neural-Network-model
Customer Churn neural network model developed using Keras and Stochastic Gradient Descent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Built a Neural Network model to predict Banking Customer churn using Keras and Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD). 

The model was built on hypothetical dataset which contains information like Customer Id, Surname, Credit Score, Location, Gender, Age, Tenure, 
Estimated Salary etc. 
Our goal is to predict Customer churn i.e. customers closing their accounts in a bank based on the 10,000 records present in the dataset.
